Quickly Assess Your Website's Usability: [pagegauge.io](http://www.pagegauge.io/)

#### Background
PageGauge is a simple web tool to assess the usability of any website using automated analysis. It programmatically assesses various usability criteria and provides a "Usability Score" as an output. It was built in a ~1 day distributed hackathon, and is free and open-source.
